            <h2>What is AI Development?</h2>
            <p>
                AI development involves the creation of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, speech recognition, translation, visual perception, and more. AI can be classified into narrow AI (specialized systems) and general AI (systems with broad abilities like human intelligence).
            </p>
            <p>AI development consists of several subfields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Creating algorithms that allow systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong> A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Building systems that understand and generate human language.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Enabling computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Learn AI Development?</h2>
            <p>Learning AI development requires a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and understanding of AI frameworks and tools. Key areas to focus on include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python is the most popular language for AI development due to its simplicity and the availability of AI libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Understanding linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics is crucial for designing algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong> Learn about supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks and Deep Learning:</strong> Study artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Learn how to preprocess, visualize, and analyze data.</li>
            </ul>
